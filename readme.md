## NodeJs Basic Server:

Functional basic webserver. The HTML, CSS and images are all served via the tiny server. I really got carried away with this and its pretty irrelevant to what the assignment was. But It was fun and kept me motivated to play with CSS. I also learned how a server works, ie Express.JS. And how you'd route the static files as well as the views. Which this is nothing like, but its very basic. I do plan to write a small one that will route and allow the use of middleware.
